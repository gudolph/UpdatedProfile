                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <hr>
                <p>Growing up I was always on the move. My dad was in the Army and after being born in San
                    Francisco
                    I moved with my family across the US and Europe. Finally he retired from the service and started a
                    practice
                    in Grand Junction, Colorado where I finished high school with the great High Rockies at my
                    backdoor.</p>
                <p>After graduating I came to Utah and met my wife while doing theatre at Westminster College, a hobby
                    that
                    we've both enjoyed for many years since. I finished up a Philosophy degree and then a Biology BS at
                    the
                    U
                    in hopes of doing something in the medical field. After a lot of consideration I decided that being
                    a
                    developer would make for a satisfying and fulfilling career I could sink my teeth into. Now I spend
                    my
                    free
                    time playing piano, singing in choirs with my wife when we have a chance, and taking my dogs on
                    hikes.</p>
